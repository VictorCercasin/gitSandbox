This rep was created so I can try to understand what the actual fuck happens with git
I hate it because nothin makes sense when I use it
Lets see if this changes anything

So far so good. I'm going to just add another simple commit

So, this is main. It has only the stuff I wrote in the beginning and now this. So now I have three branches with different stuff on each

Lets make another commit in main branch and see if anything explodes

I think we should do it again just for kicks

Now lets merge all branches into main. My objective is to maintain this text exacly like it is now
