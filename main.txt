This rep was created so I can try to understand what the actual fuck happens with git
I hate it because nothin makes sense when I use it
Lets see if this changes anything

So far so good. I'm going to just add another simple commit

All good! Lets create a new branch and see what happens

Now I'm in a new branch. Lets commit this and see what happens

I needed to set an uptream branch for that commit, but it worked.
Now I want to repread the process but seeing what happens if the branch I created in my 
local rep and the upstream branch are not named the same.

So no, you can't create an upstream branch with a different name. Interesting
